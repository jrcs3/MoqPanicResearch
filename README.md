# Moq Panic Research

Inspired by learning that MOQ 4.20 has a new dependency on which SponsorLink, a utility that sends data back to a server in the cloud.
In this repo, I do the same mocks with [MOQ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/moq/) (version 4.18), [NSubstitute](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NSubstitute) and [FakeItEasy](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FakeItEasy). 
I do not include [RhinoMocks](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RhinoMocks/) because it hasn't been updated for a decade.
